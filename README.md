# ALX Listing App
The ALX Listing App project aims to scaffold and lay the foundational structure for a modern Airbnb clone.

## Project Structure
### 1. Components directory: These components can be anything from simple buttons and input fields to complex custom components that encapsulate specific functionalities.
### 2. Interfaces directory: Interfaces define the structure of an object, specifying the properties and methods it should have. They are used to enforce type safety and improve code readability.
### 3. constants directory: This directory will be used to store reusable constants such as api urls,Color palettes,Theme variables.
### 4. public/assets directory: The public directory is specifically designed to store static assets that you want to be served directly to the browser without any server-side processing or bundling

## Instructions
**Setting Up a Next.js Project Locally**

### Prerequisites:
1. **Node.js and npm (or yarn):** Ensure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system. You can download the latest version from the official Node.js website.

### Steps:
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   - **Git:** If you have a Git repository for your Next.js project, clone it to your local machine:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/VictorOzo/alx-listing-app.git
     ```
   - **Manual Download:** If you have a ZIP file, extract it to your desired location.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   - Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project's root directory:
     ```bash
     cd alx-listing-app
     ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Install the required dependencies using npm or yarn:
     ```bash
     # Using npm
     npm install

     # Using yarn
     yarn install
     ```

4. **Start the Development Server:**
   - Start the development server to see your project locally:
     ```bash
     # Using npm
     npm run dev

     # Using yarn
     yarn dev
     ```

   - This will typically start your development server on `http://localhost:3000`. Open your web browser and go to this URL to view your project.

### Additional Tips:
- **Hot Reloading:** Next.js supports hot reloading, which means changes to your code will be reflected in the browser without a full page refresh.
- **Custom Port:** You can specify a custom port for the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev --port 3001
   ```
- **Building for Production:** To build your project for production, use the following command:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
- **Running the Production Build:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

By following these steps, you should be able to set up and run a Next.js project locally. If you encounter any issues, refer to the official Next.js documentation or ask for help in the Next.js community.
